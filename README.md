## Metronome WebApp

Example Metronome WebApp to showcase the pulsation of different songs based on their BPM.

### Setup

To run the app:

1. Clone the repository using `git`
2. Run `npm install` inside the application directory
3. After the installation, run `npm run dev` and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application
4. (_Optional_) To use the "Spotify BPM" functionality you need to set your API keys on the `.env` file. This feature uses the [client_credentials](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/client-credentials/) grant flow, securing the API credentials on the server.

To run the tests:

- Run `npm test`
